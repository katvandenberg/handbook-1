\section{Formatting the MLA essay}
When setting up your word processor for an MLA-formatted document, use the following settings and rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Set 1'' margins on all sides of the document.
\item Double-space the entire document, including block quotes.
\item In the top left portion of the first page, type your name, instructor's name, course title, and date on separate, double-spaced lines.
\item Include your last name and a page number on each page in the top right corner of the header.
\item Include a centered title on the first page.
\item Indent the first line of each paragraph with a tab set to 0.5''.
\end{itemize}

When a quotation runs more than four typed lines, use a \textbf{block quote}. A block quote is a free-standing block of text, set apart from the rest of the text. (See the following page for a visual example of block quote formatting in MLA). When formatting blockquotes in MLA, use the following four rules: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Begin the block quote on a new line. 
\item Indent every line of the quote 1'' from the left margin (two tabs). 
\item Do not use quotation marks around the quoted material. 
\item Place the parenthetical citation \emph{after} the final punctuation of the quoted passage. For example:
\end{enumerate}

The following page is a model for the MLA-formatted document:

America's Foreign Policy Future?

\hspace{.4in}While all of the world may indeed be a stage, we must be decisive in the measures we take in order to prevent the curtain from closing too soon. We currently live in an era of great political uncertainty. After the Cold War, as Dave Smith has argued, America suddenly became the stand-alone world power, dominating international treaties, coalitions, and movements (34). This "unipolarity" has resulted in one of the most wholly economically prosperous and peaceful periods of time in history. As one economist explains,

\hspace{.8in}The most remarkable result of the fall of the Soviet Union has been the

\hspace{.8in}incredible proliferation of capital markets to every corner of the globe.

\hspace{.8in}From Bangalore to Brazil, Columbia to China, capital flows have  

\hspace{.8in}circled the globe, all protected by the military forces of the world's last 

\hspace{.8in}remaining superpower. (Johnson 77)

However, this economic prosperity comes at a great cost. American military deployments at bases across the world cost the American taxpayers dearly. As much as

\section{In-text citations}
The MLA style uses parenthetical citations to indicate the author and page number of sources. These parenthetical citations take two forms. The first form is used when the source you are citing \emph{is known or understood} by your audience. The second form is used when the author being cited is \emph{unknown or unclear}. 

In the following sentence, the author of the source in question is obvious:

\begin{quote}According to scholar James Frey, "Americans eat five pounds of ice cream annually" (78).
\end{quote}

Since the author, James Frey, is understood, the citation uses \textbf{only the page number} of the source.

In these versions of the sentence, however, the author is not stated:

\begin{quote}
According to one scholar, "Americans eat five pounds of ice cream annually" (Frey 78).
\end{quote}
Or:

\begin{quote}
Studies have shown that the American people consume an average of five pounds of ice cream every year (Frey 78).
\end{quote}
In the first sentence, the author is referred to only as a generic "scholar." To give the reader information on which scholar is being cited, Frey's name is included in the citation. In the second sentence, the author describes the report, not its author; as a result, the student has included Frey's name to indicate whose report is being referenced.

\section{Bibliography}

MLA requires a bibliography at the conclusion of the essay that includes the full citation of the sources cited within the essay. In MLA, the bibliography is known as the Works Cited page. When setting up a Works Cited page, use the following rules and characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Center the words "Works Cited" at the top of the page.
\item Use your last name and the page number on the right side of the page's header.
\item Double-space the Works Cited entries.
\item Alphabetize the entries by the author's last name.
\item If an entry runs more than one typed line, indent the second (and any subsequent) line with a .5'' tab.
\item If two or more works by the same author are used, list the entries alphabetically by title. After the first entry, replace the author's name with three dashes followed by a period. (See the entries from St. Augustine on the following page).
\end{itemize}


Here is an example of a MLA formatted Works Cited page:

Although there are hundreds of MLA forms for citing everything from books to email conversations, they may all be reduced to two basic forms. Let's call them "book'" and "periodical." All of the other forms are merely variations of these two.

\section{Book form}

\hspace{.4in}Publication (Web or Print).

Variations on this form include a \textbf{book by multiple authors}, a \textbf {book with an editor}, a \textbf {translated book}, an \textbf {edition}, and so on. Each of these additional forms will require slight alterations or additions to the basic form.
