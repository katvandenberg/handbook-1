\chapter{Active vs. Passive Voice}

Verbs may be expressed in either the passive or active voice. In the active voice, the subject of the sentence is performing the action expressed in the verb. In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon. 

While the passive voice is often a requirement in scientific or technical writing (where 
the focus is on a particular process or experiment) it should be avoided in most other forms of academic writing. 

As the following sentences illustrate, the active voice 
produces less wordy and more precise sentences:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Passive}: My first visit to Italy will always be remembered by me.

\textbf{Active}: I will always remember my first visit to Italy.

\medskip

\textbf{Passive}: 	An A was given to Johnnie by professor James.

\textbf{Active}: 	Professor James gave Johnnie an A.

\medskip

\textbf{Passive}: Mistakes were made.

\textbf{Active}: We made mistakes.

\end{quote}
